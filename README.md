[DEFAULT]

;Serial port used for communication with the UPS
SERIAL_PORT = /dev/ttyS0  

;The number of symbols per second transferred
BAUD_RATE = 115200

;URL to access GEDE-SNMP-UPS-Interface
HOST = 192.168.1.97      

;Default user of GEDE-SNMP-UPS-Interface
USER = ge                

;Default password for GEDE-SNMP-UPS-Interface

;Here you can add the list of hosts for remote shutdown.
;Using SSH public-key authentication to connect to a remote system. 
;SSH public-key authentication relies on asymmetric cryptographic 
;algorithms that generate a pair of separate keys (a key pair), one 
;"private" and the other "public". You keep the private key a secret 
;and store it on the computer you use to connect to the remote system. 
;Conceivably, you can share the public key with anyone without compromising 
;the private key; you store it on the remote system in a .ssh/authorized_keys 
;directory.

HOST1 = root,example1.com
HOST2 = root,example2.com
HOST3 = root,example3.com
